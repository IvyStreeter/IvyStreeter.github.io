<ul>
<li>Course covers Scratch, C, Python, and SQL, with a focus on problem-solving and critical thinking skills.</li>
<li>Unary notation, also known as base one, is a system where counting is done using individual units, such as fingers, with each unit representing one digit, and this system is used when counting people or objects one by one, literally using fingers as digits</li>
<li>The question of how high one can count with one human hand is posed and the correct answer is actually 31, which can be achieved by using patterns and combinations of fingers</li>
<li>The binary system, also known as base 2, is a system that uses two potential states, such as down or up, or black and white, to represent information, and this system is used by computers to understand and process data</li>
<li>In the binary system, information is represented using binary digits, also known as bits, which can have a value of either zero or one, and this is in contrast to the decimal system, which uses 10 digits to represent information</li>
<li>Computers use millions of tiny light switches, known as transistors, to store information, and these transistors can be turned on or off to represent zeros and ones, allowing computers to store and process information</li>
<li>To count higher than zero or one, multiple bits, or light bulbs, are needed, and with three bits, a computer can represent numbers up to seven, using different combinations of zeros and ones to represent each number</li>
<li>Computers represent numbers using a binary system, where a series of switches or light bulbs can be turned on or off to represent different values, such as 0 and 1, with the pattern off off off representing 0, off on off representing 2, and on on on representing 7</li>
<li>The binary system uses a base 2 number system, where each digit can have one of two values, 0 or 1, and the columns are weighted differently, with the rightmost column being the ones column, the next column being the twos column, and so on, using powers of 2</li>
<li>The powers of 2 are used to weight the columns in the binary system, with the first column being 2 to the 0, the second column being 2 to the 1, and so on, allowing computers to count from 0 to 7 using only 3 digits</li>
<li>A byte, or eight bits, can represent a range of decimal numbers from 0 to 255, and this range is calculated by adding the powers of two represented by each bit, so if all the bits are ones, the total is 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1, which equals 255</li>
<li>The use of powers of two, such as 255 and 256, is common in the computer world and programming because these are the typical units of measurement used by systems, and understanding these concepts can help clarify how computers represent and process information</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> Unicode<a href="introduction.html#unicode" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Computers initially used eight bits to represent characters, which limited the number of possible characters to 256, sufficient for the English alphabet but not for other languages that have more glyphs, and nowadays computers use more bits, such as 16, 24, or 32 bits, to represent a wider range of characters</li>
<li>With 32 bits, it is possible to represent as many as 4 billion possible characters, which is a significant increase from the initial 256 characters, and this has enabled the representation of all human languages, past, present, and future, as well as pictograms like smiley faces and emojis</li>
<li>The goal of the Unicode system is to be backwards compatible with the existing character set, known as ASI, and to represent all human languages, as well as pictograms and emojis, using a super set of representations that can be 16, 24, or 32 bits</li>
<li>The Unicode Consortium releases new emojis every year, which can cause compatibility issues if devices are not updated with the latest software, resulting in some emojis not being displayed correctly, and the popularity of emojis can be seen in a cloud diagram that shows the size of each emoji indicating its relative popularity</li>

<div id="color" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="1.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Color<a href="introduction.html#color" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Computers represent color using a system called RGB, which stands for red, green, and blue, and this system is used to allocate some number of bits or bytes to represent the color of a single dot, or pixel, on the screen</li>
<li>The RGB system typically uses three numbers, or three bytes, which is 24 bits per pixel, to represent the color of a pixel, with each number representing the amount of red, green, and blue in the color</li>
<li>Each of the three numbers in the RGB system uses eight bits, or one byte, to represent the amount of red, green, and blue, with the highest possible value being 255, and the actual value representing a proportion of this maximum amount</li>
<li>When a computer combines the wavelengths of light represented by the RGB values, it produces a specific color, such as a medium amount of red, a medium amount of green, and a little bit of blue, which results in the color code for a single dot, representing a specific shade of yellow</li>
<li>The pattern of three bytes, such as 72, 73, and 33, is used to represent the color of a single pixel, and this pattern is repeated for every pixel on the screen, with the combination of these pixels creating the image that is perceived by humans</li>
<li>Digital photographs are made up of millions of bytes, with each byte corresponding to one of the pixels on the screen, and at least three bytes are used to represent every one of these dots, resulting in large file sizes, such as 1 megabyte or 10 megabytes, depending on the resolution of the image</li>
<li>Representation: Computers represent colors using a combination of bytes, with millions of bytes used to represent images, and this representation is made possible by fancy compression software that can use fewer bytes, but in general, it is the combination of these bytes that allows for color representation</li>
<li>Videos are represented as a series of images, similar to flipbooks, where the human mind perceives motion when individual images are displayed in rapid succession, with videos typically consisting of 30 or 24 frames per second, making them large files to download due to the high number of images</li>
<li>Sound can be represented using numbers that correspond to specific frequencies, which have a direct relationship to the pitch of a note, and additional numbers can be used to represent volume and duration, allowing for the digital representation of music</li>
<li>The representation of musical notes can be achieved by assigning specific patterns to each note, such as A, A sharp, and C, and using multiple bytes to represent the pitch, volume, and duration of each note, similar to how RGB values represent colors</li>
<li>The interpretation of zeros and ones depends on the context in which they are used, such as a calculator program interpreting a pattern as numbers, a text messaging program interpreting it as letters, or Photoshop interpreting it as a color, and programmers have the power to write code that tells the computer how to treat these patterns</li>

<li>An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem, and it is essential to express oneself correctly and precisely when creating an algorithm, as explored in the concept of converting problems to solutions</li>
<li>The notion of an algorithm is introduced as a precise description of how to do something, with the operative word being “precise”, and an example of trimming a beard is used to illustrate this concept</li>
<li>Pseudocode: Implementing algorithms as programmers or computer scientists involves translating conceptual ideas into code, which can be expressed in various programming languages such as C, C++, Python, R, or Ruby, and for now, pseudo code can be used as an intermediate step</li>
<li>Pseudo code is not a formal language and can be written in various ways, with the goal of being precise and finite, and it can be used to break down complex tasks into step-by-step instructions, as demonstrated with the example of finding a person in a phone book</li>
<li>The process of finding a person in a phone book can be broken down into steps, including picking up the phone book, opening to the middle of the book, looking at the page, and checking if the person is on the page, with conditional actions based on the outcome of each step</li>
<li>The example of finding a person in a phone book illustrates the importance of considering all possible scenarios, including the case where the person is not in the book, which can be a common source of errors in software development if not properly handled</li>
<li>Pseudo code can include verbs or actions, which are referred to as functions, and conditional statements, such as if-else statements, which are used to make decisions based on Boolean expressions, which are questions with a yes or no answer</li>
<li>Boolean expressions are named after mathematician Boolean and are used to make decisions in code, with indentation playing a crucial role in determining the logical flow of the program, as seen in the example of finding a person in a phone book</li>
<li>The use of pseudo code and conditional statements can help programmers anticipate and handle potential errors, such as the case where a person is not in the phone book, and can help prevent bugs and mistakes in software development</li>
<li>The characteristics of pseudo code, including the use of functions, conditionals, and Boolean expressions, will be used throughout the discussion, with a focus on developing a more technical understanding of these concepts</li>
<li>The example of finding a person in a phone book demonstrates the importance of using indentation to convey logical significance in pseudo code and many programming languages, with the indentation determining which actions to take based on the outcome of conditional statements</li>
<li>Most computer programs have four fundamental characteristics, including the ability to make decisions and create cycles or loops, and even in relatively simple real-world algorithms, these characteristics are present, as seen in the example of searching for John Harvard in a phone book</li>
<li>The use of loops in programming can potentially create an infinite loop, where the program gets stuck in a cycle forever, but in the case of the phone book algorithm, the loop will eventually stop because the problem is being divided and conquered, and the phone book will eventually run out</li>
<li>The algorithm for searching the phone book will stop when John Harvard is found or when the entire phone book has been searched, and this is guaranteed to happen because the problem is being broken down into smaller parts</li>
<li>When writing code, it is possible to accidentally create an infinite loop, which can cause the computer to become unresponsive, but there are ways to terminate or break out of these conditions, and these techniques will be explored later</li>
<li>The concepts of loops and decision-making will be used to solve real-world problems, including visual and audio problems, and these solutions will be explored after a break</li>
<li>The ability to write code that can solve complex problems and potentially take control of the computer is a powerful tool, but it requires careful attention to detail to avoid creating bugs or infinite loops</li>
<li>The techniques for terminating or breaking out of infinite loops and solving real-world problems will be demonstrated, allowing users to write code that can be used to solve a wide range of problems</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Artificial Intelligence<a href="introduction.html#artificial-intelligence" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Artificial intelligence has been a prominent topic in recent months and years, and it will be revisited at the end of the course to explore its connection to the concepts learned throughout, particularly in relation to writing code</li>
<li>Implementing a chatbot that answers questions and has conversations can be done using pseudo code, which may involve conditional statements, such as responding with “hello” if the user says “hello”, but this approach can become impractical with a large number of possibilities</li>
<li>The number of conditional statements required to handle various questions and responses can escalate quickly, making it impossible for programmers to write an infinite number of conditionals, and this is where artificial intelligence comes in to figure out the responses based on probability and statistics</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence, such as chatbots, is typically trained on large amounts of data, allowing it to learn and respond to questions without requiring an infinite number of conditional statements, and this is often achieved using large language models and neural networks</li>
<li>Neural networks are inspired by the human brain’s neural structure, where each circle represents a neuron, and the arrows represent pathways between them, and these networks are trained on huge amounts of data to produce answers to questions based on probability and statistics</li>
<li>The goal of neural networks is to output the most probabilistically likely answer to a given question, and this approach is used by companies like Google and Microsoft to power their AI systems, without relying on programmers to anticipate every possible question</li>
<li>The concept of using a rubber duck as a debugging tool has been around for a long time, where programmers talk to the duck to explain their code and identify errors, and this idea is also used in CS50’s own AI persona, which takes the form of a rubber duck</li>
<li>The technique of “rubber duck debugging” or “rubber ducking” involves talking through a problem to a physical or virtual entity, like a duck, to help clarify and solve the issue, and this technique can be a valuable programming tool</li>
<li>Virtual tools, such as chat GPT, are not allowed to be used in the class due to policy, but students are encouraged to use CS50’s own AI-based tools, which are designed to guide students towards solutions without providing outright answers</li>
<li>CS50’s AI-based tools will be available throughout the course and can be accessed through a specific URL, as well as being embedded in the Visual Studio code programming environment, where a virtual “duck” will also be present</li>
<li>The course will cover programming concepts, including the use of AI, and will start with writing code in a language other than C, as the code written in C can look cryptic and is not the focus of the initial lessons</li>
<li>The initial focus of the course will be on a more visual incarnation of programming, rather than the zeros and ones that the computer understands as input, and actual programming will be done after a short break</li>
<li>The programming environment that will be used is a cloud-based version of Visual Studio code, where students will be able to access the virtual “duck” and other tools to help with their programming tasks</li>
<li>Computers only understand code written in zeros and ones, but programmers will be writing code at a higher level, using languages that are more understandable and easier to work with, such as C, Python, and JavaScript, with the understanding that computers can represent higher numbers using zeros and ones</li>
<li>The programming language C is an older language that remains popular due to its speed and ability to make devices operate quickly, and it will provide a conceptual foundation for introducing other languages, even though it may seem scary at first due to its punctuation and syntax</li>
<li>The value of learning C is not that it will be used directly in most jobs, but rather that it will provide a foundation for understanding other languages, such as Python and JavaScript, which offer more functionality and abstract away some of the details that will be focused on in the coming days</li>
